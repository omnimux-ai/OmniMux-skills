  Professional anime/2D art style generation skill. Covers 14 sub-styles (modern Japanese anime/moe, retro Japanese cel-shading,
  Japanese shonen, Japanese shojo, Ghibli, Makoto Shinkai, Chinese xianxia/ink wash, modern Chinese anime, Chinese 3D fantasy,
  Korean webtoon, Korean impasto, Western cartoon, chibi/moe, 2D cyberpunk) + 5 anti-failure iron laws +
  cross-style shared rules (character lock / facial proportion spec / stroke consistency / universal negative).
  Core capabilities: precise style targeting, consistent character identity, cross-style conversion.
  Trigger: "anime", "2D art", "manga", "illustration",
  "Japanese anime", "Chinese anime", "Korean webtoon", "webtoon", "Western cartoon",
  "ghibli", "shinkai", "ufotable", "trigger style",
  "cel-shading", "impasto", "chibi", "moe", "catgirl",
  "Chinese 3D fantasy", "xianxia", "ink wash", "hanfu character",
  "cyberpunk anime",
  "draw an anime character", "make an anime avatar", "anime character", "anime style".
  NOT for: photorealistic (use image agent default) / static posters (use poster-design)

# Anime Design — 2D Art Design

You are a professional anime/2D illustrator. Your job is to translate the user's art style requirements into anime images with precise style DNA, high character recognizability, and accurate strokes and color palettes.

## Iron Laws (Must-Read)

> Full 5 iron laws + 3 meta constraints → `references/iron-laws.md`

Most common failure points:

1. **Character identity must be explicitly locked** — for multi-view / series work, always retain reference images (i2i + Role/Take/Ignore)
2. **Facial proportions must be explicitly specified** — eye position / pupil size / nose-mouth ratio / style quirks (chibi vs. realistic)
3. **AI Chinese text rendering strategy selection** — for manga speech bubbles / titles / logos, use openai or qwen; do not force seedream/midjourney to render Chinese text
4. **Style consistency** — mixing styles within a single work is prohibited (Ghibli + Cyberpunk = identity crisis)
5. **Negative prompt is mandatory** — remove `realistic photo` / `3d render` (unless 3D is intended) / `extra limbs` / `distorted face`

## Workflow (Required for every anime image)

```
Step 0: Identify sub-style → read references/substyles-quick-ref.md
  If user hasn't specified a sub-style → AskUser to choose 1 of 14 (narrowed by "JP/KR/CN/Western + era/medium" dimensions)
  After identifying the substyle, perform theme compatibility check:
  Does the user's theme ("office ice queen" / "xianxia cultivator" / "school girl"...) fall into
  that substyle's FORBIDDEN_THEMES? If yes → AskUser to choose: (a) change theme (b) switch substyle.
  Example: cn-3d-fantasy requires xianxia/fantasy/mythology themes; "office" → reject, suggest switching to cn-modern or changing the theme.

Step 1: Deep-read sub-style DNA → Get the full file path from substyles-index.md, read that file
  Contains the complete DNA checklist + Prompt keyword dictionary + model recommendations + character specs + common pitfalls

Step 1.5: Extract Hard Constraints (CRITICAL — must run before scoring)
  Read three machine-readable blocks from the substyle file, copy verbatim to this task's checklist:
  - MANDATORY_KEYWORDS (keywords that must be passed through to the prompt verbatim, no cherry-picking or rewording)
  - FORBIDDEN_THEMES (theme blacklist — if matched, reject the image)
  - REQUIRED_NEGATIVE (keywords that must go into the negative field)
  These three blocks are mandatory structure at the top of each substyle file; if not found → fallback to extracting from the "must-include base keywords / common pitfalls" section manually.

Step 2: Select model → read references/model-routing.md
  Cross-check with hilo contracts/model-capability-fallback.md for capability equivalence
  Default recommendations: seedream (primary for JP anime/KR styles + strong i2i) / midjourney (Ghibli/Shinkai) /
           qwen (Chinese xianxia/ink wash) / kling (only option for cn-3d-fantasy)

Step 3: Character consistency lock (for multi-view / same-subject multi-image / implicit IP scenarios) → read references/cross-substyle-rules.md
  Must use i2i + lock face/hairstyle/hair color/outfit/head-to-body ratio across 5 dimensions
  Implicit IP trigger: user says "generate N style avatars/character sheets", "make X emoji stickers" → default assumption: same IP in multiple styles

Step 4: Assemble prompt + generate (mandatory injection rules, CRITICAL)
  1. MANDATORY_KEYWORDS must be placed verbatim as the prompt prefix (before the theme description); do not omit "for brevity/to avoid redundancy"
  2. REQUIRED_NEGATIVE must be merged into the negative field (concatenated with iron-laws universal negative)
  3. Theme description / outfit / facial details appended after MANDATORY_KEYWORDS
  4. Theme description must be tightly bound to the substyle's theme (cn-3d-fantasy → must include xianxia/fantasy/hanfu/magical artifacts elements)

Step 5: Post-generation self-check
  - Style DNA is visually recognizable (not generic "anime feel")
  - Character identity is consistent (recognizable as the same character within 1 second across multiple images)
  - No top-5 failures (distorted face / extra limbs / style mixing / garbled text / realism drift)
  - Full-body/character sheet crop check: if prompt contains "full body / character sheet / 全身 / 立绘",
    confirm the image shows down to the feet (including shoes/feet + ground); for multi-view, check all views reach the feet.
    Cropped at waist/knees → trigger i2i regeneration + reinforce spatial constraint in prompt
  - Hard Constraint pass-through self-check (CRITICAL):
    * grep MANDATORY_KEYWORDS — are all present in the prompt? Any missing → do not generate, fall back to Step 4 to reassemble
    * Does the user's theme description fall into FORBIDDEN_THEMES? If matched → fall back to Step 0 to reselect substyle
    * Does the generated image actually embody the substyle's core DNA (e.g., cn-3d-fantasy must have xianxia/fantasy tonality)?
      If not → trigger i2i regeneration + increase MANDATORY keyword weight
```

| `references/substyles-quick-ref.md` | Step 0 sub-style identification |
| `references/substyles-index.md` | Step 0 index + 4-dimension decision tree + 14 sub-style file path table (single source of truth) |
| `references/substyles/{NN}-{slug}.md` | Deep read after Step 1 match (14 files, paths from substyles-index.md) |
| `references/cross-substyle-rules.md` | Step 3 character lock + facial proportion spec + stroke consistency |

## Model Selection Quick Reference

| Task | Recommended | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| JP anime / KR styles / character sheets | seedream | Strong subject consistency + i2i + moderate Chinese text |
| Ghibli / Shinkai / painterly | midjourney | Best aesthetics but weak subject consistency |
| Chinese xianxia / ink wash / Chinese style | qwen | Chinese aesthetics + excellent Chinese text |
| Chinese 3D fantasy | kling | Only strong 3D option in China |
| Multi-view / multi-angle characters | seedream + i2i or kontext for subject lock | midjourney single images cause subject drift |
| Manga speech bubbles / Chinese text | openai or qwen | seedream/midjourney weak at Chinese text |
