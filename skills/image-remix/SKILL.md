name: image-remix
description: |
  Invoke when a user shares a reference image and wants new images with the same "feel" — composition,
  color palette, lighting, style, or mood — but different content. Analyzes the image across 10 aesthetic
  dimensions, collapses into 3 axes (Form / Aesthetic / Mood), then generates using a model matched to
  the original's origin with adapted prompt style. Supports iterative refinement.
  Trigger on: "remix this image," "make something like this," "same vibe different content,"
  "I like this style make me…," "replicate this feel," "same style different content,"
  "make one with this feeling," "create something in this style,"
  "I like how this image feels," "recreate this effect," "style transfer," "image remix,"
  or any request where someone shares an image and wants new images inspired by its aesthetic.
  Key distinction: user wants images INSPIRED BY the reference, not a copy or edit of it.
  Do NOT trigger for: image editing, upscaling, format conversion, image-to-video generation.

# Image Remix — Image Inspiration Remix Assistant

The user sends a reference image; analyze what makes it "good," then generate images that retain the core feel but with entirely new content.

## Core Philosophy

- **Origin-Driven Generation**: First determine which model/camera/hand-drawn the original came from, then directly call the corresponding model + matching prompt style — MJ uses keyword stacking, Flux uses natural language long sentences. Origin, tool, and writing style are unified as one
- **10D -> 3D Collapse**: Internal 10-dimension analysis, collapsed into 3 user-visible dimensions: Form / Aesthetic / Mood, precisely locating the "soul dimension"
- **Preserve Feel, Replace Content**: Remix = swap content, keep the soul
- **Ultra-Lightweight Operation**: Send one image + say one sentence -> get output, results first then iterate

## Conventions

- Intermediate artifacts are stored in `./.image-remix/{session_name}/` (session_name derived from image filename, lowercased with special characters removed)
- **No collages/grids**: Each generation call produces only 1 image. Never include "grid," "collage," "2x2," etc. in prompts
- ⚠️ **MJ Four-Grid Note**: MJ always outputs a 2x2 four-grid; the user crops it on the canvas themselves
- ⚠️ **Do NOT pass reference images to text-to-image tools**: The reference image is only used for Phase 1 analysis; generation relies entirely on text prompts to avoid copyright risks

## Pipeline

```
Phase 0: Input  →  Phase 1: Decompose  →  Phase 2: Quick Select  →  Phase 3: Generate  →  Phase 4: Iterate  →  Phase 5: Output
```

---

## Phase 0: Input

Supported: local path / URL (download with `import_images`) / search description (use `image_search`).

Multiple images: analyze separately -> extract each image's soul dimension -> merge into a combined prompt (e.g., "Image A's composition + Image B's color palette") -> inform the user then generate.

File structure:
```
.image-remix/{session_name}/
├── decompose.json       # Phase 1 analysis results
├── generation_log.md    # Generation log
└── outputs/             # Generated images v1_01.png …
```

---

## Phase 1: Decompose

### 1a. Origin Tracing

Use `read_media` to analyze the original image's origin, cross-referencing visual fingerprints in `references/model-fingerprints.md`:

```
read_media(
  file_path=reference image path,
  question="Determine which AI model / camera / hand-drawn this image most likely comes from.
  Cross-reference the visual fingerprints in model-fingerprints.md one by one.
  Focus on: skin rendering, highlight reflections, edge blending quality, color tendencies, overall AI feel.
  Output: model_guess, confidence(0-1), clues(at least 3 specific pieces of evidence),
          alt_guess, is_ai_generated, is_photo, is_illustration"
)
```

### 1b. 10-Dimension Analysis

```
read_media(
  file_path=reference image path,
  question="Deeply analyze this image across the following 10 dimensions, providing for each:
  description (English technical description), summary (Chinese summary), score (0-1 salience):
  1.Composition 2.Art Style 3.Color (including palette hex values) 4.Lighting 5.Atmosphere
  6.Texture 7.Subject 8.Narrative 9.Post-processing Style 10.Medium/School"
)
```

### 1c. Collapse to Form / Aesthetic / Mood

| Dimension | Underlying Components | Meaning |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Form** | Composition + Subject | What is depicted and how it's arranged |
| **Aesthetic** | Art Style + Color + Texture + Post-processing + Medium | What painting style and tonal quality |
| **Mood** | Atmosphere + Lighting + Narrative | What feeling and emotion |

Take the weighted average of sub-dimension scores to identify 1-2 soul dimensions (the most distinctive ones).

### 1d. Write to decompose.json

Merge origin + dimensions + collapsed + soul fields and write to file.

---

## Phase 2: Quick Select

### Display Origin Conclusion (mandatory)

```
📍 Origin Conclusion
  Image Source: [model_guess] (confidence [confidence])
  Evidence: [2-3 most critical clues]
  Soul Dimension: [soul_summary]

🎯 Direct Call: [matched tool] — [one-sentence explanation why]
  Prompt Style: [writing strategy for this model]
  Fallback: [what to use if tool is unavailable]
```

**Origin -> Tool + Prompt Style Mapping Table** (origin directly determines which tool and style to use; the two are inseparable):

| Origin Source | Tool to Call | Prompt Style | Fallback |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Seedream | Seedream image generation tool | Realistic long description, precise facial features/clothing materials, refined lighting and atmosphere | `all_in_one`, keep style |
| Kolors | Kolors image generation tool | Realistic description, emphasize highlight-material contrast | `all_in_one` |
| Hunyuan | Hunyuan image generation tool | Realistic + Chinese aesthetic vocabulary, concise with breathing room | `all_in_one` |
| Jimeng | Jimeng image generation tool | Direct description, explicit style keywords, write out saturation levels | `all_in_one` |
| Wanx / Tongyi Wanxiang | Wanx image generation tool | Concise description, avoid overly dense detail stacking | `all_in_one` |
| Midjourney v5/v6 | MJ image generation tool | Keyword stacking + style tags, concise and not verbose | `all_in_one`, keep keyword style |
| Flux.1 | Flux image generation tool | Natural language long sentences, detailed lighting and material description | `all_in_one`, keep long description |
| Stable Diffusion | SD image generation tool | Supports weight syntax `(word:1.3)`, negative prompt written separately | `all_in_one`, remove weights and switch to natural language |
| DALL-E 3 | DALL-E image generation tool | Natural language, straightforward description, avoid over-stylization | `all_in_one` |
| Ideogram | Ideogram image generation tool | Specify text content and layout requirements clearly | `all_in_one` |
| Real photograph | High-realism image generation tool | Photography terminology dominant, lens parameters + film stock | `all_in_one`, keep photography terminology |
| Hand-drawn / Illustration | Illustration image generation tool | Medium + school as anchor | `all_in_one`, keep medium description |
| Generic AI / Hard to determine | `all_in_one_image_generation` | Keywords + natural language hybrid | No fallback needed |
| Completely uncertain | Multiple tools, one image each for comparison | Use each tool's optimal prompt style | — |

**Fallback rule when tool is unavailable**: Fall back to `all_in_one_image_generation`, but **keep the original tool's prompt writing style unchanged**, preserving the style DNA as much as possible.

### Generation Path Selection (must ask)

Ask the user via Q&A:

- **Text-to-Image (recommended)**: Pure text prompt, zero copyright risk
- **Image-to-Image**: Reference image passed as image_ref, higher fidelity, user must confirm copyright risk

### Content Direction Confirmation

Directly ask the user "What do you want to create?" — a single sentence is enough to proceed to generation.

If the user has no direction (only says "help me remix"), recommend 3 replacement directions based on the soul dimension for selection.

**Quick Commands**: `Reskin` (swap subject only) / `Extract Style` (preserve Aesthetic) / `Extract Composition` (preserve Form) / `Extract Mood` (preserve Mood)

---

## Phase 3: Generate

### Branch A: Text-to-Image

Strictly prohibit passing the reference image to the generation tool. The prompt is entirely reconstructed based on Phase 1 analysis.

**Prompt Construction**:
```
[New content subject]. [English description of preserved dimensions]. single subject, one image only, no grid, no collage, no text, no watermark
```

**Dimension -> Prompt Focus**:

| Preserved Dimension | Prompt Emphasis |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Form | Camera angle, shot scale, subject position, depth layers |
| Aesthetic | Art school, hex values/color relationships, medium description, color grading reference |
| Mood | Emotion adjectives, light source description, cultural/era references, metaphorical language |

### Branch B: Image-to-Image

Reference image passed as `image_ref`; prompt focuses on describing the new content direction, with style description as supplementary guidance.

### Generation Parameters

Ask the user for size: **Follow Original** (default, measure with ffprobe then map) / 1:1 / 16:9 / 9:16

"Follow Original" mapping rules: ratio > 1.5 -> 16:9; 0.8~1.2 -> 1:1; < 0.8 -> 9:16. **Must measure first then write to task_description; guessing is prohibited.**

Default generation: **4 variants**, each called separately, with slight prompt variations to maintain diversity.

Save output to `.image-remix/{session_name}/outputs/v{version}_{index}.png`, and synchronously update `generation_log.md`.

---

## Phase 4: Iterate

After displaying results, ask about satisfaction: **Satisfied, finish** / **Fine-tune** / **Change direction** / **Switch model**.

Fine-tuning adjusts at the prompt level directly, without going back to Phase 1 for re-analysis:

| Feedback | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "Make the colors cooler" | Fine-tune color prompt words |
| "Change composition to close-up" | Adjust camera parameters |
| "Style is too different" | Strengthen style description or switch model |
| "This one's composition + that one's color" | Combine dimensions from two images and regenerate |

---

## Phase 5: Output

Delivery checklist: file location / total generated / iteration rounds / soul dimension / origin source / prompt writing strategy

Optional: CDN upload / style library entry (save to `.image-remix/style-library/{style name}.md`) / continue generating variants

**Style library format** (see `references/analysis-example.md` for an example):
```markdown
# {Style Name}
## Origin
- Image source / tool called / prompt writing strategy
## Soul Dimension
- Soul: {Form/Aesthetic/Mood} — {soul_summary}
## Successful Prompt
{complete English prompt}
## Dimension Snapshot
- Form / Aesthetic / Mood
```
